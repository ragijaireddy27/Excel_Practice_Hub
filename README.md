## Basic Formulas

This section contains a variety of essential Excel formulas that are commonly used for data analysis:

- **SUM, AVERAGE, MIN, MAX** – Basic mathematical operations for summarizing data.
- **IF** – Conditional logic formulas to return different values based on certain criteria.
- **TEXT Functions** – Includes functions like `LEFT`, `RIGHT`, `MID`, `CONCATENATE` (or `TEXTJOIN`), and `TRIM` to manipulate text data.
- **DATE and TIME Functions** – Learn how to calculate differences, extract parts of dates, and format dates/times.

## Pivot Tables

Pivot tables are powerful tools for summarizing and analyzing large datasets. In this section, you will learn to:

- **Create Pivot Tables** – Understand how to summarize data using rows, columns, and values.
- **Group Data** – Group data by date, category, or other dimensions.
- **Add Calculated Fields** – Create custom calculations within Pivot Tables.
- **Filter and Sort** – Apply filters to focus on specific data points and sort them in meaningful ways.
- **Design Pivot Charts** – Visualize your Pivot Table data with dynamic charts.

## Lookup Formulas

In this section, you will work with lookup formulas to extract data from large tables:

- **VLOOKUP** – Look up values in a table based on a specific key.
- **HLOOKUP** – Similar to VLOOKUP, but searches for data horizontally.
- **INDEX-MATCH** – A more flexible alternative to VLOOKUP.
- **XLOOKUP** (available in newer versions of Excel) – A more advanced and user-friendly function for searching and returning values from a range or table.

## Data Cleaning - Bike Sales

In this section, you will practice cleaning a dataset related to bike sales. The tasks include:

- **Removing Duplicates** – Identify and remove duplicate rows in the dataset.
- **Handling Missing Data** – Fill in missing values, remove rows with missing data, or use other techniques to handle incomplete records.
- **Standardizing Text** – Clean and format text data to maintain consistency, such as converting text to uppercase or removing extra spaces.
- **Splitting and Merging Columns** – Separate data in a single column into multiple columns or combine data from multiple columns into one.
- **Identifying and Correcting Errors** – Look for common errors in data entry and apply corrections (e.g., fixing typos or incorrect dates).

## Small Project - Bike Sales Analysis

This hands-on project allows you to apply your Excel skills to a real-world dataset. You will:

- **Clean Bike Sales Data** – Apply data cleaning techniques to prepare the dataset for analysis.
- **Create Pivot Tables** – Use Pivot Tables to analyze sales performance by product, region, or time period.
- **Build Charts** – Create dynamic charts (e.g., bar, line, pie charts) to visualize sales trends and performance.
- **Develop a Dashboard** – Design a dashboard that provides key insights and visualizations about bike sales. This section focuses on presenting the data in an interactive and easy-to-understand way.
